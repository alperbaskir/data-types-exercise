# Getting Started

# Details about stack that I used
I buildt up this project using mainly **React.js, Context.API** and **TypeScript**
 - I used TypeScript because I needed to work with certain data types that I had previously received.
 - I used Context.API because I couldn't handle all state management with props drilling patterns. Then you may ask me why you don't use **redux**. But I approached this task the same way I would approach a medium-size production application; I think that Context.API is quite enough for state management on projects of this size.
 - Finally, I used React because I'm more confident in react.js which is great to make it easier to build user interfaces
